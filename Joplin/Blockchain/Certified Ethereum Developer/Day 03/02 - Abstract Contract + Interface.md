02 - Abstract Contract + Interface

## Abstract Contract
- A contract with only function signatures.
- Can be used to define a protocol.
- The abstract contract can be inherited by other contracts and can be extended by these new contracts.


## Interface

- Interfaces in Solidity are similar to abstract contracts, but the main difference is that they cannot have their functions implemented.
- Interfaces can be inherited.
